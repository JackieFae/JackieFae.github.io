            Use the simulation results to construct a deck for yourself and an opponent.
            In the left section, click on a deck slot to bring up a list of eligible bots.
            Click again to lock in a bot, or click the slot icon to clear the selection.
            Once filled with a bot, a slot will present the primary combat value in white.
            The dimensions of the value may be selected using the Bot, Bandwidth, and Resource toggles.
          <ul>
            <li>Using "Per Bot," combat value is the expected score (in resources) for an additional bot: descriptive for small army sizes.</li>
            <li>Using "Per Bandwidth," combat value is divided by bandwidth cost: the bot's contribution in a maxed out force.</li>
            <li>Using "Per Resource," combat value is normalized by resource cost in %: a bot's return on investment.</li>
          </ul>
            Take note when reading these values that a bot's overall value in the deck view is based on an average of the other selected bots.
            The composition builder in the next section provides more insight into army count and tech order specifics.
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p class="text-justified">
            As the decks are filled, slots are ornamented with coloured arrows and values indicating synergies and anti-synergies with friend and foe.
            Each slot refers to every other using an upper and lower mini-grid for the player and opponent decks, respectively.
            A slot always indicates its own position in the deck with a dark circle.
            An upward arrow indicates synergy; the bot gains a benefit from the bot in the referenced slot.
            A downward arrow indicates anti-synergy, or that the bot loses effectiveness due to a pairing.
            A white circle is used when the synergy is minor (less than 5% of the base value) in either direction.
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            Many bot pairings result in one-sided synergies.
            For example, the Crab loses value when paired with the Hunter, but the Hunter gains more than is lost (especially when scores are normalized for cost, due to the Crab's lower price).
            These relationships can be explored in detailed by expanding a slot to see all the values laid out together.
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            To view a bot in detail, simply hover over it with your mouse to bring up a detailed version on the right.
            In this version, arrows are replaced with numerical values.

        <p class="text-justified"><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>
        <p class="text-justified">
          Welcome, reader, please enjoy the following self-indulgent blog/guide/paper on the nature of combat in the (at time of writing) upcoming RTS <a href="https://www.playbattleaces.com">Battle Aces</a> from Uncapped Games.
        </p>
        <p class="text-justified">
          In Battle Aces (BA from here on to spare my phalanges), players take part in matched competitions consisting of short, single games with play comprised of a harshly pared down subset of elements common to the RTS genre.
          It is descended most directly from Blizzard's 2010 title, StarCraft II, and, like that game, is fast and furious.
          It emphasizes tight unit control, intelligent tactical positioning, and multitasking and feeds back to the player similar vibes: huge futuristic drone armies pushing larger-than-screen-height battle lines while navigating delicate compositional variety enabled through silky smooth pathing and responsiveness.
        </p>
        <p class="text-justified">
          It is unlike nearly every other RTS in most other aspects, having been designed with the intent to remove unnecessary elements.
          BA features no building placement, no worker management, no trade-offs between the collection of disparate resources, very little "macro"-style gameplay at all, in fact.
          Likewise, it includes no high ground advantage, no covering behind terrain, no capture points or optional objectives, and no map variety whatsoever.
          Finally, it features no single-player mode, limited team play, and few practice/non-competitive modes.
        </p>
        <p class="text-justified">
          In place of genre staples, BA offers each player the opportunity to construct a custom faction from a growing supply of unique units.
          Combinations are limited by a few simple rules: Decks contain 8 slots for selecting units, units come in 5 tech categories, and 1-2 slots per deck are allotted to each category.
          The deck building provides the main source of variety and strategy in the game and, along with skill expression, decides the overwhelming portion of how games unfold and how players interact with the main game mode, competitive play up and down a ranked ladder.
        </p>
        <p class="text-justified">
          For my money, this emphasis on player faction diversity, and the asymmetry it creates, pulls BA out from the realm of RTS and into a unique zone shared by only a handful of other titles, like Pocketwatch Games' <a href="https://www.toothandtailgame.com/">Tooth and Tail</a>, and the criminally underappreciated <a href="https://www.absolvergame.com/">Absolver</a> from SloClap that looked to blend TCG-style deck construction with real-time action.
          All RTS games since my youth have had some amount of faction diversity, with the decision to play one or another made outside the gameplay proper and leeching into the strategy by dictating the available timings and counters.
          BA, by so frontloading the faction creation and simplifying in-game decision-making, has placed almost all this activity outside the moment-to-moment gameplay.
          Player decks have narrow spaces to adjust to eachother and the breakneck pace prefers hurling players into the haze of combat rather than having them sit and stew over long-term decisions.
          This feeds the main gameplay loop well, once a deck is built a player can play again and again with match-making coming quickly and games lasting as little as 2 minutes and never more than 10.
        </p>
        <p class="text-justified">
          It also means that the game is more fundamentally about how a players choice in deck relates to the behaviour of the ladder population as a whole.
          It is a <b>game of averages</b> and puts a premium on players understanding the high-level trends in deck choices in order to engage with the ladder successfully.
          While this is a mindset already espoused at the top of the ladder in many RTS games, BA, through its design, more directly asks players to disavow the need/expectation to seek to win every individual encounter.
          It is not an uncontroversial choice.
          There are players who express frustration with the lack of direct control, or concern that the gameplay complexities of asymmetrical information and long-term planning that can normally balance players have been reduced to pre-game decisions.
          While these concerns are, in my mind, overanxious, I think they arise from a legitimate discomfort that grows out of finding oneself in a new and unfamiliar space even though that space is merely a new lens on the world they already occupy.
          RTS players are not always TCG players, card and tabletop gamers are not always RTS players, and everyone (myself included) who engages with this game is going to need a bit of time and assitance in making the switch.
        </p>
        <p class="text-justified">
          So that is, finally, why we are here.
          I will repeat this phrase throughout this document and certainly over and over during the lifetime of the title, <b>"Battle Aces is a game of averages,"</b> and so, to describe it, to play it, to master it, we will have to learn to speak the language of averages.
          As we go on, I will be presenting a statistical analysis that combines the rules of deck-building in BA with the rules of its combat to model as much of the game as I can at a population level.
          As time goes on, this analysis will improve and deepen and, with enough head-scratching and a little luck, I think I can create a holistic description of the game's interactions that players can use as a tool to learn, or bring with them onto the ladder to upset the meta.
        </p>
        <p class="text-justified">
          I will add a few final notes on the project's status, goals, and intentions before we move on.
          Simple Aces Monte Carlo is written in C and will be open-source (once it is presentable) so that the source, too, can be used as a learning tool or for any branching works interested parties can imagine.
          I am happy to collaborate and accept feedback on the design and content of the simulation, this page, and my analysis, or answer questions about my decisions. 
          You can reach me <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Hi_Dayvie/">here</a> and <a href="https://github.com/JackieFae">here</a>.
          I am treating this both as a contribution to a growing community and a learning experience for myself, so I reserve the right to make mistakes and take my time as I painstakingly figure out optimal and accurate solutions to the many interesting problems.
        </p>
        <p class="text-justified">
          I hope you find something here to help you on your Ace's journey, and I look forward to working with you.

      <div id="overview">
        <p class="section-label">Overview</p>
        <p class="text-justified"><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>
        <p class="section-sublabel">On Monte Carlo Models</p>
        <p class="text-justified">
          A Monte Carlo model is a type of stochastic representation that describes a large and perhaps unknowably complex real-world system by breaking it into smaller, well-behaved components or inputs (some or all of which can be realistically modelled as random), combining them together, and iterating the collective over an enormous number of random permutations.
          This generally has the effect of both expressing the length and breadth of variation in the random inputs, as most combinations of very large and very small values occur in the system over the course of a very large number of iterations, and of describing the system's behaviour in the average case.
        </p>
        <p class="text-justified">
          The classic example that recurred throughout my education in engineering is a production line.
          A production line has multiple inputs, different materials, parts, even other partially assembled components, that each come with lead times and often suffer random delays or hiccups.
          It also includes several stages or steps where a worker performs a task, like machining, assembling, painting, or testing.
          Each stage takes time and the time taken, too, can be modelled as random variation about a mean. 
          Taken even farther, in the emotionless language of our corpo-verlords, the human resources can be modelled as random with each worker's labour efficiency varying about the population means of skill and speed.
        </p>
        <p class="text-justified">
          There is more at play, however, than the single time taken for a particular stage.
          The process of a production line is sequential with each stage having to wait until one (or more, if multiple sub-elements have to come together at once) previous stages are completed creating, sometimes extreme, delays.
          Likewise, a stage of production is usually limited in how many inputs it can receive and might experience a bottleneck as the speed of previous stages creates too many inputs and a queue forms.
          In both cases, the aggregate behaviour of the system very quickly becomes chaotic and leads to headaches when attempting to predict output.
        </p>
        <p class="text-justified">
          This is where the power of Monte Carlo modelling shines.
          With many behaviours colliding and decisions cascading through or bouncing off one another, simpler analyses leave a lot of nuance on the table.
          If one assumes the mean time for every stage, one woefully underestimates the compounding effects errors.
          If one assumes the worst case scenario, where everything goes wrong at once, one is equally unsatisfied, finding in-hand a prediction of the apocalypse.
          And all in between, the chaotic nature of the system defies attempts to soothe uncertainty.
        </p>
        <p class="section-sublabel">On Event-Based Simulation</p>
        <p>
          Monte Carlo modelling creates and collates diverse data, but this framework puts no limits and gives no guidance on how the system runs or how the data are generated.
          The details of the simulation are based on other factors.
        </p>
        <p class="text-justified">
          In the digital world, these are usually practical concerns regarding time, memory usage, the purpose of the sim itself.
          For example, an aircraft flight simulator needs to perform in real-time to train real-world actions, while a simulation of stress in a building design can take a week or so to run so long as it is very accurate.
          As well, simulations can vary based on whether they center discrete objects or high-level, chronological events.
          In the game Battle Aces, simulating the units themselves is part of the point, it enhances the fun to see discrete objects interact, while in the above production line example only specific moments in time when a process starts or stops are really needed and details like worker bathroom breaks can be abstracted into the time computation.
        </p>
        <p class="text-justified">
          We can break simulation broadly into categories real-time and non-real-time and further into agent-based and event-based.
          In many cases, it feels like an agent-based simulation is the truest representation of the system.
          However, it turns out that event-based simulation can often represent the same interactions and is usually orders of magnitude faster and lighter.
          Inevitably, some interactions of agents can be highly complex and even rely on inter-agent relationships.
          These relationships are, in event-based sims, forced to be approximated an acceptable casualty of performance requirements.
        </p>
        <p class="text-justified">
          For those reasons, I have undertaken to reformulate agent-behaviours in BA into simplified timed events.
          While agents are still present in the simulation, they are not the owners of any actions but are updated and acted upon by the events that occur.
          Discussing how and where this assumption creates distance between the model and reality is an important part of this analysis and will come up frequently in more detailed discussions.
        </p>
        <p class="section-sublabel">Goals</p>
        <p class="text-justified">
          Battle Aces (and most competitive games) is a massive nest of interconnected selections, decisions, actions, costs, trade-offs, and delays that somehow coalesce into a climactic battle between two players and, finally, an outcome.
          The advantage that BA has in this arena is that its rules are relatively simple, its playspace relatively small.
          We can imagine a possible breakdown of the game into its constituent components and their recombination into a Monte Carlo model.
        </p>
        <p class="text-justified">
          Such a simulation will not be perfect, of course, predictive models never are.
          Its ability to describe professional play will be limited, as top-tier players become so by eliminating much uncertainty and inconsistency from their play.
          Similarly, its ability to describe the outcome of a specific battle through population level numbers will be lesser than some more direct analyses.
          Rather, what a Monte Carlo simulation of BA offers is the prediction of trends, a crystalization of population-level behaviours: the choices of the playerbase holistically, the meta of the ladder as a whole.
          As well as a prediction of ranges, helping to show the upper and lower ends of value for each player choice.
          Finally, statistical modelling opens to door to unravelling complex correlations that describe how many variables can interact and which depends most on which.
        </p>
        <p class="text-justified">
          To get nitty-gritty, I hope to be able to a few key values in relation to the count of a unit used in a battle to find its:
          <ul>
            <li><b>Overall contribution to victory in a general case</b> -- measuring the improvement in battle results as more of that unit are added,</li>
            <li><b>Counts of highest return</b> -- those numbers where adding or removing a unit impacts score the most,</li>
            <li><b>Synergies and anti-synergies</b> -- the units with and against which a unit sees increased or degraded performance,</li>
            <li><b>Approximate skill cap</b> -- the degree to which player ability and unit performance are correlated.</li>
          </ul>
          As well, I want to analyse individual unit values: health, attack range, damage, speed, ability charge count, etc.
          Then I want derive similar numbers to describe these in terms of score contribution with an eye to pulling out which elements of a unit's specific make up contribute most to their performance.
        </p>
        <p class="section-sublabel">Details</p>
        <p class="text-justified">
          While I don't want to put anymore detail on top than I really need, I think it does make sense to preview the content of the actual simulation, in advance of detailed discussion <a href="#howitworks">here</a>.
          Generally, a Monte Carlo consists of:
          <ul>
            <li>A (pseudo) random number generator -- selected for large periods of generation without repetition and thread-ability,</li>
            <li>An algorithm for setting up initial model conditions -- including all relevant variables and leveraging the PRNG to ensure realistic spread,</li>
            <li>An algorithm for propagating the models from initial to end conditions -- leveraging the PRNG to create variation in intermediate states,</li>
            <li>Statistical techniques for interpretting the outcomes.</li>
          </ul>
          The random number generator and statistical analysis we will leave for later and focus on the BA-specific details.
          The two middle algorithms are the bulk of the model and run together for a large number of iterations to generate a mountain of outputs.
        </p>
        <p class="text-justified">
          The model imagines games between two players, each moves through the same initial steps:
          <ul>
            <li>Deck selection -- up to 8 bot types are selected for each player according to BA deck building rules,</li>
            <li><b>NOT YET LIVE</b> Mutation -- the stats of the selected bot types are randomly moved up or down by a small amount,</li>
            <li>Resource Allotment -- A random army size is generated using resources matter and energy, both players receive the same allotment,</li>
            <li>Tech Choice -- A random number of upgrades are chosen for each player, unlocking some bots, with the tech cost subtracted from the allotment,</li>
            <li>Army Composition -- The remaining allotment determines how many of each bot a player has, total are adjusted when selections prevent cost parity,</li>
            <li>World Creation -- The units are placed in the simulated game world, all simulations use the same world size and separate players a fixed distance,</li>
            <li>Event Execution -- Everything that occurs in BA is an event, each is placed in a chonological queue and then executed, generating more events if needed,</li>
            <li>Implemented Events Include:
              <ul>
                <li>Creating a Unit</li>
                <li>Targetting a unit -- simple logic targets the nearest valid target, <b>turn speed to be added</b>,</li>
                <li>Moving toward a location -- includes intercepting a target unit and resolving collisions,</li>
                <li>Attacking a unit -- including wind up and recoil times as well as projectile speed,</li>
                <li>Taking damage -- resolves scoring for a unit that is destroyed</li>
                <li>Destroying a unit -- resets other units targetting the victim</li>
                <li>Start/Stop HP Regen</li>
                <li>Blink -- instantly moves to target position,</li>

                <li>Detonate -- Destroys the unit on attack, does not grant score to the defender,</li>
                <li>Destruct -- Destroys the unit if their are no more valid targets,</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
          As you have no doubt noticed. There are a few things conspicuously absent from the simulation, namely:
          <ul>
            <li>Terrain,</li>
            <li>Expansion and Core buildings,</li>
            <li>Workers and resource collections,</li>
            <li>Addition of new units to an on-going battle,</li>
            <li>Researching new tech during an on-going battle.</li>
          </ul>
          Each of these missing pieces has an impact on the utility of the sim.
          The main point to keep in mind is that the values the model generates without reference to macro can only explain a bots value within a pure combat context.
          Values should be expected to vary when examined in relation to attack timings and in economically focused play.
        </p>
        <p class="section-sublabel">On Linear Regression</p>
        <p class="text-justified">
          The analysis of the model results is based on a multivariate regression to a linear model.
          A linear model is one where an input adds proportionally to an output.
          Such a model may have any number of inputs, each with its own coefficient of proportionality or weight.
          The inputs to this system are army composition (bot counts) and player skill for each of two players.
          A multivariate scheme describes a model with numerous output values.
          In our case, each output corresponds to the score earned by a particular bot type.
          At present, this means the system is generating 49 linear relationships as outputs, each with 100 input weights.
        </p>
        <p class="text-justified">
          The process of determining this relationship is that of finding the line of best fit to a set of data.
          It should be familiar to anyone who has completed a university physics lab, and will be detailed later.
          The nuance to keep in mind now is that this number does not exist in isolation, but also has a corollary value: the error, which describes how closely the actual data actually matches the line of best fit.
        </p>
        <p class="text-justified">
          I expect that in understanding these many results, the analysis will provide significant insight into the workings of gameplay.
          However, the linear representation is certain to miss some nuance, especially for very large numbers where small changes in weight result in large differences in predicted score.
          It is likely to be most descriptive in the base case, for valuing first (or first few) bots added.
        </p>
        <p class="text-justified">
          Because we want to preserve both the direct value and describe the error, we present the results in a few ways.
          Below you will step through the process of creating the results.
          First, examples of the event-based simluation are shown as pseudo-replays to indicate the type of behaviour analysed.
          Beyond that you will find unregressed results of simulations for each bot, with comparisons showing the variability in score relative to the regression line and unit cost.
          Next, the main line regression results, sorted by bot, and presented in a few different values (score, win rate, etc.), relating how that bot increases of decreases player outcomes.
          Finally, the interplay of bots is described with a more detailed breakdown of several additional regressions performed on subsets of the data to pull out specific synergies and anti-synergies between the bots.
        </p>
        <p class="text-justified">
          As well, I have included a few sections applying the data to different features that might be of ancillary interest.
          One is a deck builder, a much requested element, that uses the weighted impacts of bots on each other to create a prediction of deck power.
          The other generates a fake ladder and estimates how a variety of decks and player skills would distribute themselves.

          Below the selection is a bar showing the score comparison between both players along with their army compositions.
          On the left is a scroll-able field showing the position and approximate actions of each bot.
          Replays are shown with 1 second resolution.
          Each second, the bots position is updated and its highest priority action is recorded.
        </p>
        <p class="text-justified">
          These replays are a good first step in understanding the inner workings of the simulation.
          Initial set-up, including the selection of amry compositions and placement, can be seen at the 0th second.
          Army position is a crude fan spanning roughly nineties degrees and placing bots by type
          Unit properties such as size, speed, and range are easily visible.
          Other values like damage and attack rate are less immediately obvious, but you can take my word that those are also correct.
          Not all activity is visible, however the reports give a good idea of how timing and position within the simulation corresponds to live gameplay.
        </p>
        <p class="text-justified">
          Most bots in most situations move directly toward their nearest valid target and begin to attack.
          This is simple behaviour, but more or less in line with basic in-game bot behaviour.
          In combat, bots spread out and surrounded their enemies.

          Data are charted on the x-axis by count of selected bot count and on the y-axis by sum of bot score.
          Each individual bot scores points equal to its resource cost if it is alive at the end of the sim plus points proportional to damage dealt toward to the destruction of an opposing bot.
          That is, a bot that deals 50% of the damage to a destroyed bot is worth an additional 50% of that bot's resource value.
          A bot will score points for damage dealt whether or not it is alive at sim end.
          Scores are then combined so that each point represents the sum of all points earned by all bots of the selected type.
        </p>
        <p class="text-justified">
          Points are drawn in orange if the score value exceeds the resource cost at that bot count and in blue if it falls short.
          Two lines are drawn over the data.
          The white line shows the linear increase in resource cost with bot count, delineating blue and orange points.
          The coloured line shows the aggregate regression result for the selected bot.
          This shows the approximate increase in score for adding additional bots.
          This line is drawn in orange if bot scores tend to be better than costs, and blue if they tend to be worse.

          In the plot, units are ranked from left to right based on a selected measure from the table below.
        </p>
        <p class="text-justified">
          Detailed data are provided in the table.
          Value is the average points toward the final score earned by adding one more of the given bot.
          Norm Value is the value above or below the cost of that bot (divided by the bots cost to give a percentage).
          % Adv Wins is the percentage of victories where the winning player had more of that bot.
          % Dis Wins is the percentage of victories where the winning player had fewer of that bot.
          % Pick Rate is the percentage of games in which that bot appeared.
        </p>
        <p class="text-justified">
          Selecting filters will present the analysis results for a reduced dataset that highlights each unit's value against a particular subset of opposing bots.
        </p>
        <p class="text-justified">
          NOTE: These are very slow to generate, so they are left out of the beta version.

        <p class="text-justified">
          A mock ladder based on a simple Elo MMR system and Battle Aces league tiering shows how the results of the analysis might map onto a live ladder.
          The ladder consists of 3500 players, each playing a single deck with a randomly generated "true skill" value.
          Players play 10000 games against opponents selected for nearby ladder score.
        </p>
        <p class="text-justified">
          Press a league button to show the ranked list of players in that league.
          Ladder score indicates displayed rank "in-game".
          MMR indicates the Elo score used to determine match making (this is to allow emulating ladder thresholding like what was used in beta1, though it is not used in the present simulation).
          Expected rank shows the projected power of a player based on their combination of skill and deck selection.
          Skill is the true MMR value of a player without regard to deck.
        </p>
        <p class="text-justified">
          Below the main table are summaries of bot usage in various leagues.
          On the left, bots are ranked by popularity in the selected league.
          On the right, bot popularity is shown across all leagues with Iron on the left extreme and Top Ace on the right.
